Think of it like house numbers on a street: every house has a unique number (its “index”), and if you know the number, you can directly access that house.\nThis same idea applies to vectors, matrices, and data frames in R. Instead of manually searching through your data, you use indices to point to exactly the values you want.

    "text": "Indexing with matrices\nA matrix is a two-dimensional data structure in R (rows × columns). Indexing works in a similar way to vectors, but now you have to specify both row and column positions.\nFor example:\n\nmy_matrix &lt;- matrix(\n  data = c(2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6), \n  nrow = 2, \n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\nmy_matrix\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    2    3    4    5\n[2,]    6    6    6    6\n\n\nTo extract data, use the format matrix[row, column]:\n\nmy_matrix[1, 2]     # element in row 1, column 2\n\n[1] 3\n\nmy_matrix[1:2, 3:4] # rows 1–2, columns 3–4\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    4    5\n[2,]    6    6\n\n\nThis is like reading a spreadsheet: first locate the row, then the column."
